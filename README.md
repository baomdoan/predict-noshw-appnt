Using Featuretools to predict no_show appointments.

In this notebook, the main goal is to utlise Featuretools to generate new features (Feature Engineering) based on the given [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joniarroba/noshowappointments) which is taken from Kaggle. 

This notebook will mostly follow tutorial given by Featuretools [demo](https://github.com/Featuretools/predict-appointment-noshow). However, I will also do some data analysis and attempting to perform Feature Selection because of the "curse of dimensionality" when a givem dataset has too many features.
